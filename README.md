# Blockage Detection in Coronary Artery with Image Processing

This project focuses on developing an image processing algorithm to detect blockages in X-ray images of angiography. The algorithm provides the location of the blockage and calculates the percentage of blockage in the coronary artery, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

## Description
The developed image processing algorithm can analyze X-ray images of angiography to detect blockages in the coronary artery. By segmenting the artery, identifying blockages, and calculating the percentage of blockage based on the artery's radius, the algorithm provides valuable insights for medical professionals to assess the severity of cardiovascular conditions.

## Process
The blockage detection process involves the following steps:

1. **Uniform Image Creation:**
   - Original Image:
